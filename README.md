# Xuarazmi Code Generator Tool (IntelliJ Plugin)
## Introduction
The XUA Tool is shortened form of Xuarazmi, named after al-Khwarizmi, Persian mathematician and poet, formerly Latinized as Algorithmi (and yes that's where the word algorithm comes from).

XUA is a PHP Code Generator tool, mainly used for creating API Services and in some cases for creating complete websites (including back-end and front-end). The aim of XUA is to generate all trivial and technical codes for us so we only need to write the codes that actually require human intelligence. In other words the only thing that XUA does not do is it's name, we need to give it algorithms and it generates a PHP code that do the rest by itself.

a XUA project is actually a combination of Definitions and PHP codes. XUA generates some other PHP codes based on definitions and glues them with human-written PHP codes as algorithms to create a complete PHP project. There are several stuff that we can define, including Supers, Constants, Entities, Methods. In this Documentation we try to cover all the information needed to use each of these -as we call- Definition Blocks properly and create a fast, efficient, secure and scalable PHP Project.


## Getting Started
First of all you need to meet prerequisites.

### Installing IDE
Install an IntelliJ-based IDE. We recommend installing IDEA Community Edition (since it's free), using the following command.

```
$ sudo snap install intellij-idea-community --classic --edge
```

### Cloning XUA Plugin due to development
First of all you must have a copy of project on your device.(It does not matter which way you use, although using .zip make somethings easier.)

Befor doing anything else, make sure that the bundled **_Plugin DevKit_** plugin is enabled. Install and enable [**_Grammar-Kit_**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6606-grammar-kit) and [**_PsiViewer plugins_**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/227-psiviewer).

If this your first intellij plugin, perhaps you have none of **_Gradle_** libraries and packages. So do as follows:

After you open up this project on your IDE you will see a warning(or an alert) which will guide you to donwload and install related packges.(Downloading and installing will be auto by IDE itself, **you don't have to anything by hand except accepting your IDE suggestions**, just connect to internet and if you are under limitiations caused by sanctions also connect your VPN, this process will take some times to be done and download something about 15 Gigabyte data, be patient.

### Installing XUA Plugin and dependencies
Install the XUA Editor Plugin @TODO

### Creating a New Project and Configuring It
Then you can create a new XUA project @TODO

Config @TODO

### Code Generation and Other Services
Just when you created a XUA Project and configured it, it’s a complete project and can be translated to PHP. To do so, just @TODO. XUA’s main service is to generate PHP code according to your definitions, but it can also generates a class XuaLiteral in several languages (including JavaScript, Twig, Java, Dart, etc.), and an API documentation in HTML format, including all methods, with request and response structures. It also add comments in method file as method description to the documentation. @TODO
